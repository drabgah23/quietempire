# Hello, world!
After more than four months of building silently, I felt the need to start writing about my project and, more importantly, what I plan to achieve.

However, I don't have an clear plan about what to write. Neither do I know how often I will write a post. 

I think I simply want to document my journey. A technical, financial, and self-development journey â€” although the technical part will play the major role in my post (at least in the beginning).

## Some background about me
Let me start with some background. I've been into crypto and trading space for 6 years. During that time I tried and learned a lot. From massive wins to even harder losses. I tried to become a trader, a crypto influencer, a blockchain developer, and many other things.

Some of my "tries" worked out quite well but somehow I wasn't satisfied. 

My crypto influencer journey is a good example. I quickly gained more than 100k followers across several channels. I even made so decent money with my content. However, after a few months, I knew that I don't want to put out chart analysis and discuss tokens and projects that will rug anytime soon.

Probably also worth mentioning that I had an good job while discovering the crypto and trading space. I was CEO of a technology company with more than 50 employees and actually made good money.

## Quitting my job
Nevertheless, it was back in early 2024 when I finally decided to step down as CEO. For more than a year I was unsatisfied with my job. I was sick of sitting in meetings, talking business bullshit, and doing things I was not interested in anymore.

So, I made the decision to quit my job. I had some ideas what to do next. 

Today, I know that these ideas were more like a calming pill for my brain. So, I sat there in July 2024 and started to double down on many things I had in mind. I created more content, coded apps, set up sales funnels, paid newsletter, and so much more.

At the end of the year I generated multiple revenue streams and a whopping monthly revenue of $200. What a disaster.

## What to do next?
Retrospectively, it was the best that could have happened. It forced me to sit down and think about what I really want to do. And I had one huge advantage. I tried tons of things and already knew what I liked.

One thing was clear: I wanted to "something" in crypto. So I dug deeper and looked at what fired me up and what made me throw up the last months:
- I rediscovered my passion for coding and building technical solutions
- I was 100% sure that I don't want to sell something (urgh, that limited my opportunities, lol)
- Actually, I knew that I don't want to work with people
- Moreover, I was sick of social media
- I wanted to find something that can scale and "live" without constant work from my side
- And, I still had the dream of creating something that can generate a monthly revenue of $200k

It took me a while to put the pieces together. After a few hours (or day, I actually can't remember) it became crystal-clear. 

A **trading bot** fits perfectly into my requirements. It's about coding, I can do it on my own, I don't have to sell something, and once it works it can scale massively.

And that's where the real fun started.
